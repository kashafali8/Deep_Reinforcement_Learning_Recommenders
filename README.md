## About the Project

**Motivation:**

The motivation for this project stems from the importance of personalized product recommendations in E-commerce. With the increasing amount of data generated by online shopping platforms, it has become more challenging to provide relevant recommendations to users, especially for cold items or new users with little purchase history. Inaccurate recommendations may result in a poor user experience and reduced engagement with the platform. Therefore, developing effective and efficient product recommendation strategies that can adapt to different types of user sessions and incorporate item and user features is critical. Additionally, the use of Deep RL recommenders in this project will allow for the exploration of more sophisticated recommendation techniques and potentially improve the accuracy of the recommendations. By comparing the performance of different recommenders, this project aims to provide insights into which approaches are most effective and efficient for personalized product recommendations in E-commerce. Ultimately, the project's outcome could help improve user engagement and satisfaction, increase sales, and benefit online shopping platforms and consumers alike.

**Project Overview:** 

This project aims to implement different session (contextual, sequential) based product recommendation recommenders for the E-commerce use case, and will incorporate item features for cold items. The goal would be to compare the performance of these recommenders on two different dataset, namely Retail Rocket and Diginetica, through two offline evaluation metrics: NDCG@k and HR@k. We will be comparing the performance of a SASRec model to a hRNN (hierarchical RNN) model that also accounts for item features. In this project, we aim to develop effective and efficient product recommendation strategies for E-commerce that can adapt to different types of user sessions and leverage available features for improved performance.

## Datasets

**Retail Rocket:**

**Diginetica Dataset:**

Diginetica is a company that specializes in developing personalized recommendation systems for E-commerce. They have provided a dataset, called the Diginetica Challenge dataset, which is available on the CodaLab platform. The dataset includes anonymized user interactions with items on an E-commerce website. It consists of two parts: a training set with over 4 million user interactions and a test set with around 1 million interactions. The interactions include views, clicks, and purchases, and cover a variety of item types, including books, movies, and music. In addition to the interaction data, the dataset also includes metadata on each item, such as titles, categories, and descriptions. The goal of the Diginetica Challenge is to develop a personalized recommendation system that can accurately predict user interactions on the test set based on the training data. The challenge provides an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to explore and develop state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for E-commerce applications. For the purpose of our project, we primarily leverage the view and purchase logs, and also the product_category dataset to build item features.
