## About the Project

**Task:** 

Train different session (contextual, sequential) based product recommendation recommenders for E-commerce use case with item and/or user features inside for cold items/users, and compare the performance of the recommenders. 


**Requirements:**

In the deliverables and experiments, one of the recommenders needs to be a Deep RL recommender [DRL2] and at least two different datasets are used for
training/testing. Also, at least two offline evaluation metrics are used for benchmarking.

**Our Approach:**

We selected two e-commerce datasets for our project: H&M Dataset and dataset2. We assessed a Deep Reinforcement Learning model on each of these datasets and compared performance using two recommender evaluation metrics: metric1 and metric2.
